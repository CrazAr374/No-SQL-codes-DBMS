# DBMS Remaining Codes

Welcome to the DBMS remaining codes repository! This repository contains the remaining code examples and solutions for Database Management System (DBMS) concepts. The codes are designed to help students and developers understand and implement CRUD operations in MongoDB, covering practical applications in Java.

## Contents

This repository includes:
- **Java code for MongoDB**: A Java-based example demonstrating CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with MongoDB.
- **Sample Collections and Data**: Code to initialize and work with sample data in MongoDB collections.
- **DBMS Concepts**: Practical implementations of key DBMS concepts in MongoDB, making it easy to see theory in action.

## Usage

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - MongoDB installed locally.
   - Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
   - MongoDB Java driver included in your project.

2. **Setup**:
   - Start the MongoDB server (`mongod`).
   - Run the provided Java code using your favorite IDE or from the command line.

3. **Run the Code**:
   - The program offers an interactive menu to insert, update, delete, and view data in a MongoDB collection.
   - Follow the prompts to enter key-value pairs, update or delete documents, and see output directly in your terminal or console.

## About

These codes are provided to support students in their DBMS studies and to demonstrate practical database operations with MongoDB in Java. Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your learning needs.
